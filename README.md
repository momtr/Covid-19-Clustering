### Interpretation

- green: good treatment (e.g. South Korea, Japan)
- blue: medium treatement (e.g. Austria, Hungary)
- red: bad treatment or other reasons (e.g. France, Italy, Spain, USA) 

As it can be seen, many African states have a low increase in the number of infections but a very high increase in the number of deaths -> bad health system.
